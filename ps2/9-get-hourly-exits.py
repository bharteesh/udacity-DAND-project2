def get_hourly_exits(df):
    '''
    The data in the MTA Subway Turnstile data reports on the cumulative
    number of entries and exits per row.  Assume that you have a dataframe
    called df that contains only the rows for a particular turnstile machine
    (i.e., unique SCP, C/A, and UNIT).  This function should change
    these cumulative exit numbers to a count of exits since the last reading
    (i.e., exits since the last row in the dataframe).
    
    More specifically, you want to do two things:
       1) Create a new column called EXITSn_hourly
       2) Assign to the column the difference between EXITSn of the current row 
          and the previous row. If there is any NaN, fill/replace it with 0.
    
    You may find the pandas functions shift() and fillna() to be helpful in this exercise.
    
    '''
    
    #your code here
    df['EXITSn_hourly'] = df['EXITSn'] - df['EXITSn'].shift(1)
    df.fillna(0,inplace=True)
    return df
